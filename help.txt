Description:
People live in a routine. Every day you open your webbrowser, you mostly access a particular group of websites, depending on what you are planning to do today.
For example:
I am a student, so when it's my free time, I usually always open Facebook, Gmail and YouTube.
When I need to study, I open a couple of electric engineering related sites (including my faculty website)
When I want to learn Python, I open Python Documentation, StackOverflow etc.

With this little script, you can mark a bookmark group, for example fun and add all the websites you use when you want to have fun.
That can be done by entering: mbg fun
When done so, you will be asked to enter websites you want to put i the bookmark group, each time you enter a website press enter and when you're done, press enter on
empty (blank) line.
When done so, script saves the bookmark and now it's accessible and usable.

So when you want to access it, simply type: obg fun

The script opens your web browser, opening all sites you have added previously.

You can also add individual bookmarks, even though it's easier to add it to browsers, but the idea of this is not needing to IMPORT/EXPORT them all the time, when you can
simply carry this lightweight script with you on your USB drive or something where all your bookmarks are safe from being deleted etc.
